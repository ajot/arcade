## I'm building this because:
I'm trying to build a playground of sorts that will allow me to add any model or endpoint or inference provider. I should be able to play with them by just providing 
the API key but the UI for it should be built dynamically. If it's a text-only model then it should respond and I should be able to see the JSON request and response for them. If there is polling 
then it should automatically pull up the buttons for polling and then maybe there's a way that you can save these as UI views. I'm trying to experiment with a playground that's like the AI generation 
playground where the UI is not static. The UI is getting built for you on the fly. It should be smart enough to know what the endpoints' requests and parameters and all of that are so there should be some sort of AI that's looking at that before 
handing it off to the actual call. The UI should adapt to that so if it's a fall modeler or if it's an 11 Labs or your models, then the UI should adapt so I can actually see the response. I can see 
the image, I can download the image, I can download the MP3, et cetera. ## This will be done when: - If there is polling then it should automatically pull up the buttons for polling and then maybe
